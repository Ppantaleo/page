    "text": "What is authorship?\nAuthorship is commonly understood as the “status of being an author,” according to the most general definition by the Royal Spanish Academy (Real Academia Española (n.d.)). However, in academic and scientific contexts, this notion requires both normative and ethical clarification."

    "text": "International Criteria: ICMJE and CRediT\nThe International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) proposes four criteria that must be met simultaneously to justify authorship (ICMJE (n.d.)):\n\nSubstantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data.\nDrafting the article or revising it critically for important intellectual content.\nFinal approval of the version to be published.\nAccountability for all aspects of the work, ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity are appropriately investigated and resolved.\n\nComplementing this definition, the CRediT taxonomy (CRediT – Contributor Roles Taxonomy (n.d.)) identifies 14 specific contributor roles, allowing a more granular attribution of individual contributions to scholarly work."

    "text": "Ethics and Misconduct\nCommon authorship-related misconduct includes honorary authorship (adding someone who did not contribute) and ghost authorship (omitting someone who did contribute). Both practices breach the principles of scientific integrity (Codina (2024)).\nMoreover, authorship disputes are frequent, especially among early-career researchers. The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) offers a guide for handling authorship conflicts, emphasizing the importance of early agreements, transparent communication, and institutional protocols for conflict resolution (Committee on Publication Ethics (2018))."
