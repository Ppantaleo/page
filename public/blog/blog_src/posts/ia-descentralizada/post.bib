By simulating search query prefixes and calling search engine APIs, 106,896 autocomplete predictions were collected, and their semantic toxicity scores as measures of negative algorithmic bias were computed based on machine learning models. Results indicate that search engine autocomplete algorithmic bias is overall consistent with long-standing societal discrimination. Historically disadvantaged groups such as the female, the Black, and the homosexual suffer higher levels of negative algorithmic bias. Moreover, the degree of algorithmic bias varies across topic categories. Implications about the search engine mediatization, mechanisms and consequences of autocomplete algorithmic bias are discussed.}

Bias is taken to mean the balance and representativeness of items in a collection retrieved from a database for a set of queries. This calls for assessing the degree to which the distribution of items in a collection deviates from the ideal. Ascertaining this ideal poses problems similar to those associated with determining relevance in the measurement of recall and precision. Instead of enlisting subject experts or users to determine such an ideal, a family of comparable search engines is used to approximate it for a set of queries. The distribution is obtained by computing the frequencies of occurrence of the uniform resource locators (URLs) in the collection retrieved by several search engines for the given queries. Bias is assessed by measuring the deviation from the ideal of the distribution produced by a particular search engine.}

We also explore possible consequences of monopolization of the search engine market for advertisers and users in the form of excessive pricing and deterioration of the quality of the search results. Second, in the technical analysis part, we incorporate these considerations in a two-sided market model and analyze the rate of innovation, pricing, and quality choices by the dominant search engine. Our findings show that a dominant monopoly platform results in higher prices and underinvestment in quality-improving innovations by a search engine relative to the social optimum. More generally, we show that monopoly is sub-optimal in terms of harm to advertisers in the form of excessive prices, harm to users in the form of reduction in quality of search results, as well as harm to the society in the form of lower innovation rates in the industry.},

  abstract={Firms increasingly establish digital industrial platforms to cope with the adaption of the industrial internet of things (IIoT) paradigm. The tremendous success of digital platforms in many platform-mediated industries can be traced back to the ignition of network externalities. However, the impact of network externalities is still under discussion in the IIoT domain, and their measurement remains a challenge for platform companies. This paper outlines how network effects were measured in the existing research, deriving three dimensions of network effects for IIoT: (1) ecosystem utility, (2) complementarity, and (3) compatibility. This conceptualization is further used in an empirical study with practitioners from digital industrial platform organizations to enable performance measurement of network effects in IIoT by developing 20 key performance indicators (KPIs). Based on the empirical study results, this paper proposes a framework for balanced platform management. Utilizing the goals of a balanced scorecard, the framework emphasizes the trade-off between the contradicting perspectives on costly network effect simulation and platform earnings that platform managers need to balance. The KPI portfolio can support platform managers in implementing the framework.}

  abstract="Machine learning has recently enabled large advances in artificial intelligence, but these results can be highly centralized. The large datasets required are generally proprietary; predictions are often sold on a per-query basis; and published models can quickly become out of date without effort to acquire more data and maintain them. Published proposals to provide models and data for free for certain tasks include Microsoft Research's Decentralized and Collaborative AI on Blockchain. The framework allows participants to collaboratively build a dataset and use smart contracts to share a continuously updated model on a public blockchain. The initial proposal gave an overview of the framework omitting many details of the models used and the incentive mechanisms in real world scenarios. For example, the Self-Assessment incentive mechanism proposed in their work could have problems such as participants losing deposits and the model becoming inaccurate over time if the proper parameters are not set when the framework is configured. In this work, we evaluate the use of several models and configurations in order to propose best practices when using the Self-Assessment incentive mechanism so that models can remain accurate and well-intended participants that submit correct data have the chance to profit. We have analyzed simulations for each of three models: Perceptron, Na{\"i}ve Bayes, and a Nearest Centroid Classifier, with three different datasets: predicting a sport with user activity from Endomondo, sentiment analysis on movie reviews from IMDB, and determining if a news article is fake. We compare several factors for each dataset when models are hosted in smart contracts on a public blockchain: their accuracy over time, balances of a good and bad user, and transaction costs (or gas) for deploying, updating, collecting refunds, and collecting rewards. A free and open source implementation for the Ethereum blockchain of these models is provided at https://github.com/microsoft/0xDeCA10B.",

  abstract = {The accelerating investment in artificial intelligence has vast implications for economic and cognitive development globally. However, AI is currently dominated by an oligopoly of centralized mega-corporations, who focus on the interests of their stakeholders. There is a now universal need for AI services by businesses who lack access to capital to develop their own AI services, and independent AI developers lack visibility and a source of revenue. This uneven playing field has a high potential to lead to inequitable circumstances with negative implications for humanity. Furthermore, the potential of AI is hindered by the lack of interoperability standards. The authors herein propose an alternative path for the development of AI: a distributed, decentralized, and democratized market for AIs run on distributed ledger technology. We describe the features and ethical advantages of such a system using SingularityNET, a watershed project being developed by Ben Goertzel and colleagues, as a case study. We argue that decentralizing AI opens the doors for a more equitable development of AI and AGI. It will also create the infrastructure for coordinated action between AIs that will significantly facilitate the evolution of AI into true AGI that is both highly capable and beneficial for humanity and beyond.}

However, during that transition, several significant problems and questions need to be addressed for the field to develop ethically, such as digital privacy, ownership, and control. These are some of the reasons why the currently most popular approaches of artificial intelligence, i.e., centralized artificial intelligence (CEAI), are questionable, with other directions also being explored widely, such as decentralized artificial intelligence (DEAI), which aim to solve some of the most far-reaching problems. This paper aims to review and organize the knowledge in the field of DEAI, focusing solely on studies that fall within this category. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted using six scientific databases and additional gray literature to analyze and present the findings of 71 identified studies. The paper’s primary focus is identifying the building blocks of DEAI solutions and networks, tackling the DEAI analysis from a bottom-up approach. Future research directions and open problems are presented and proposed at the end.}

This paper provides a comprehensive review of leading AI-token projects, examining their technical architectures, token utilities, consensus mechanisms, and underlying business models. We explore how these tokens operate across various blockchain ecosystems and assess the extent to which they offer value beyond traditional centralized AI services. Based on this assessment, our analysis identifies several core limitations. From a technical perspective, many platforms depend extensively on off-chain computation, exhibit limited capabilities for on-chain intelligence, and encounter significant scalability challenges. From a business perspective, many models appear to replicate centralized AI service structures, simply adding token-based payment and governance layers without delivering truly novel value. In light of these challenges, we also examine emerging developments that may shape the next phase of decentralized AI systems. These include approaches for on-chain verification of AI outputs, blockchain-enabled federated learning, and more robust incentive frameworks. Collectively, while emerging innovations offer pathways to strengthen decentralized AI ecosystems, significant gaps remain between the promises and the realities of current AI-token implementations. Our findings contribute to a growing body of research at the intersection of AI and blockchain, highlighting the need for critical evaluation and more grounded approaches as the field continues to evolve.},

  ABSTRACT = {Blockchain technology has emerged as a transformative force with the potential to disrupt traditional industries by providing decentralized, secure, and transparent systems. However, blockchain systems face a fundamental challenge known as the Blockchain Trilemma, which posits that a blockchain cannot simultaneously achieve optimal levels of decentralization, security, and scalability. This paper addresses the Blockchain Trilemma through rigorous mathematical proof, demonstrating that achieving maximum levels of all three properties concurrently leads to inherent contradictions. By formalizing the definitions of decentralization, security, and scalability, we provide a foundational framework to understand these trade-offs. Our analysis includes a proof by contradiction and computational complexity analysis. This work aims to deepen the understanding of the fundamental limitations of blockchain technology, offering insights for future innovations and helping navigate the inevitable trade-offs.},
