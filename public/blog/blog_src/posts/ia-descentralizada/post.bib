  abstract = {This paper examines the autocomplete algorithmic bias of leading search engines against three sensitive attributes: gender, race, and sexual orientation. By simulating search query prefixes and calling search engine APIs, 106,896 autocomplete predictions were collected, and their semantic toxicity scores as measures of negative algorithmic bias were computed based on machine learning models. Results indicate that search engine autocomplete algorithmic bias is overall consistent with long-standing societal discrimination. Historically disadvantaged groups such as the female, the Black, and the homosexual suffer higher levels of negative algorithmic bias. Moreover, the degree of algorithmic bias varies across topic categories. Implications about the search engine mediatization, mechanisms and consequences of autocomplete algorithmic bias are discussed.}

  abstract = {This paper deals with the measurement of bias in search engines on the World Wide Web. Bias is taken to mean the balance and representativeness of items in a collection retrieved from a database for a set of queries. This calls for assessing the degree to which the distribution of items in a collection deviates from the ideal. Ascertaining this ideal poses problems similar to those associated with determining relevance in the measurement of recall and precision. Instead of enlisting subject experts or users to determine such an ideal, a family of comparable search engines is used to approximate it for a set of queries. The distribution is obtained by computing the frequencies of occurrence of the uniform resource locators (URLs) in the collection retrieved by several search engines for the given queries. Bias is assessed by measuring the deviation from the ideal of the distribution produced by a particular search engine.}

    abstract = {We analyze a search engine market from a law and economics perspective and incorporate the choice of quality-improving innovations by a search engine platform in a two-sided model of Internet search engine. In the proposed framework, we first discuss the legal issues the search engine market raises for antitrust policy through analysis of several types of abusive behavior by the dominant platform. We also explore possible consequences of monopolization of the search engine market for advertisers and users in the form of excessive pricing and deterioration of the quality of the search results. Second, in the technical analysis part, we incorporate these considerations in a two-sided market model and analyze the rate of innovation, pricing, and quality choices by the dominant search engine. Our findings show that a dominant monopoly platform results in higher prices and underinvestment in quality-improving innovations by a search engine relative to the social optimum. More generally, we show that monopoly is sub-optimal in terms of harm to advertisers in the form of excessive prices, harm to users in the form of reduction in quality of search results, as well as harm to the society in the form of lower innovation rates in the industry.},

  abstract={Firms increasingly establish digital industrial platforms to cope with the adaption of the industrial internet of things (IIoT) paradigm. The tremendous success of digital platforms in many platform-mediated industries can be traced back to the ignition of network externalities. However, the impact of network externalities is still under discussion in the IIoT domain, and their measurement remains a challenge for platform companies. This paper outlines how network effects were measured in the existing research, deriving three dimensions of network effects for IIoT: (1) ecosystem utility, (2) complementarity, and (3) compatibility. This conceptualization is further used in an empirical study with practitioners from digital industrial platform organizations to enable performance measurement of network effects in IIoT by developing 20 key performance indicators (KPIs). Based on the empirical study results, this paper proposes a framework for balanced platform management. Utilizing the goals of a balanced scorecard, the framework emphasizes the trade-off between the contradicting perspectives on costly network effect simulation and platform earnings that platform managers need to balance. The KPI portfolio can support platform managers in implementing the framework.}
