Welcome! I'm **Patricio Pantaleo**, a researcher and developer working at the intersection of science, open access, and web technologies.  

This blog is currently under preparation â€” I'm setting things up to share updates, ideas, and experiments related to my work and interests.

Stay tuned, and feel free to explore my [main site](https://patricio.pantaleo.ar) in the meantime.
